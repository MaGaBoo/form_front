# <h1>Form App<h1>

App created with Node and React that renders a simple and minimalist form connected to a database.

🚀 **Features:**

- Form created with React-hook-form.
- Validations carried out with Yup library.
- Other technologies used: Express, Axios, Cors.

💡 **Things I would like to implement in the future:**

- Flash message to confirm that the form has been sent. Since there is no page to redirect to, I have not been able to use it. Instead I have opted for an html message handled by a ternary operator.

- Toggle button to switch to pink theme through the UseContext hook. I have carried out tests but the result has not convinced me and I have discarded it.

⚖️ **The most complicated and what I liked the most about the exercise.**

Connecting the form to the database has been the part that has generated the most errors 🤯. I have done tests with Postman and I have checked the front and back urls to solve it.

The aesthetic part is what I have enjoyed the most. Taking the Attomo digital contact form as a model, I have kept the typography and the dominant tone dark, adding a lavender pink to give it my own pop touch.

🙏🏻 And finally, thanks to Mateo for his time and for giving me the opportunity to present my profile to Attomo.
